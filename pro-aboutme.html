        <p>I am a first-generation Latina American looking for a career in the tech field. 
           I have always been curious about how technology works, as I was introduced to using computers in my Kindergarten class where we were put into pairs to use laptops that could not handle more than one finger on the trackpad.
           You should have seen the dances the cursor did with two Kindergartners trying to share. I also have an interest in video games and robotics. 
           I started to learn HTML and CSS with the {G}Code House in the Fall 2022 and am eager to learn more about my possible place in the tech industry.
